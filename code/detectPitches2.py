# Use pyaudio to open the microphone and run aubio.pitch on the stream of
# incoming samples. If a filename is given as the first argument, it will
# record 5 seconds of audio to this location. Otherwise, the script will
# run until Ctrl+C is pressed.

# Examples:
#    $ ./python/demos/demo_pyaudio.py
#    $ ./python/demos/demo_pyaudio.py /tmp/recording.wav
